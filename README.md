# ZK-Dashboard
Zettelkasten Stats Dashboard 

Currently this little app is designed around the Mac software _The Archive_. Itcan work with other zettelkasting app. They must keep all the notes in the same directory in the MarkDown format. The name must include an eight digit UID. 

Add required modules with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Here is the output on my Dashboard so you can see what data is presented.
