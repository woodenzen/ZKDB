Zettelkasten Stats Dashboard 

Currently, this little app is designed around the Mac software _The Archive_. It can work with other Zettelkasting apps. They must keep all the notes in the same directory in the MarkDown format. The name must include an eight-digit UID. 

Add required modules with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
