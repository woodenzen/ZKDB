# Steering and Focusing Attention for Fulfillment

Subatomic: Reflections on attention. 

## Steering
- Implies a self that does the steering. Fate might be a propensity rather than a done deal. I can't explain why I chose what I chose but when confronted with a choice I seem to lean the way I've traveled in the past. To change this takes time a repetitions. Sort of like muscle building. The more some path is followed the more it get followed. 
- Awareness can expand and collapse §[[202205141425]]
- Priority of attention §[[202205141427]] 
- Attention strength training §[[202205141428]] 

## Focusing
- Noticing. This is much slower than steering which can be unconscious or so close to being unconscious that it appears automatic. Notice is both slower and instantaneous. As so a something is noticed, brought into focus, it is full noticed. Focus in this sense is not gradual. Something out of focus, blurry, confusing, until the moment it isn't.
- Focusing attention has an outsized impact [[202205092052]]
   * Where I place may attention drives who I'll become.
- Interplay Between Focus And Knowledge [[202105221453]]
- More noticing [[202012231619]]


## Attention
- How much do I have? 
- Are there different qualities of attention?
- Is attention sharable? (via writing)
- Is attention under valued or over valued?
- How do the things that capture my attention affect my life?
- I am who I am because of what I focused my attention on in the past.
- I would be a different person if I had focused my attention on different things in the past. 
- Dogen might say that I can be different now, focusing differently in the future.
- » Has Time Been Well Spent? §[[202205141439]] 
- T-March 13, 2021 §[[202205141442]] 

## Fulfillment
- What does fulfillment mean?
- What brings on the feeling of fulfillment?
  - A strong workout
  - Writing a good sentence
  - Helping others
- Why don't I focus my attention on the things that bring me fulfillment?
- Daniel Dennett said, "[f]ind something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it."

# Serendipitous Ideation

When I pay attention and notice ideas as they appear, the noticing and the attention heightens and enriches the experience. This can take a mighty effort, but the energy spent is priceless. 

Effort doesn’t have to be 100% all of the time or even 80% or 60%. Even if the effort is lackluster, any awkward intermingling with ideas intensifies apparency. §[[202106140552]]‹ Grab even the pico-sized moments and let the compounding feedback cycle explode. ›[[202106140557]] Each time ideas are danced with, we get in a little more sync.

Ideation is serendipitous. Being tackled by ideas and wrestling with them is a privilege. I am the lucky one. “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.” ― **Roman philosopher Seneca**

The volume of ideas, good and bad, valuable and worthless, appreciate and inappropriate, is increasing. The measure of a good idea is the answer to the question, “Is this consistent with the person I want to be?.” And “Is this idea intricately connected to my objectives?” And “Will it lead to an opportunity to express gratitude?” And “Will this idea encourage me to wake up to the wonderment of this bright moment?”

# Steering and Focusing Attention for Fulfillment

Subatomic: Reflections on attention. 

## Steering
- Implies a self that does the steering. Fate might be a propensity rather than a done deal. I can't explain why I chose what I chose but when confronted with a choice I seem to lean the way I've traveled in the past. To change this takes time a repetitions. Sort of like muscle building. The more some path is followed the more it get followed. 
- Awareness can expand and collapse §[[202205141425]]
- Priority of attention §[[202205141427]] 
- Attention strength training §[[202205141428]] 

## Focusing
- Noticing. This is much slower than steering which can be unconscious or so close to being unconscious that it appears automatic. Notice is both slower and instantaneous. As so a something is noticed, brought into focus, it is full noticed. Focus in this sense is not gradual. Something out of focus, blurry, confusing, until the moment it isn't.
- Focusing attention has an outsized impact [[202205092052]]
   * Where I place may attention drives who I'll become.
- Interplay Between Focus And Knowledge [[202105221453]]
- More noticing [[202012231619]]


## Attention
- How much do I have? 
- Are there different qualities of attention?
- Is attention sharable? (via writing)
- Is attention under valued or over valued?
- How do the things that capture my attention affect my life?
- I am who I am because of what I focused my attention on in the past.
- I would be a different person if I had focused my attention on different things in the past. 
- Dogen might say that I can be different now, focusing differently in the future.
- » Has Time Been Well Spent? §[[202205141439]] 
- T-March 13, 2021 §[[202205141442]] 

## Fulfillment
- What does fulfillment mean?
- What brings on the feeling of fulfillment?
  - A strong workout
  - Writing a good sentence
  - Helping others
- Why don't I focus my attention on the things that bring me fulfillment?
- Daniel Dennett said, "[f]ind something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it."

# Serendipitous Ideation

When I pay attention and notice ideas as they appear, the noticing and the attention heightens and enriches the experience. This can take a mighty effort, but the energy spent is priceless. 

Effort doesn’t have to be 100% all of the time or even 80% or 60%. Even if the effort is lackluster, any awkward intermingling with ideas intensifies apparency. §[[202106140552]]‹ Grab even the pico-sized moments and let the compounding feedback cycle explode. ›[[202106140557]] Each time ideas are danced with, we get in a little more sync.

# Serendipitous Ideation

When I pay attention and notice ideas as they appear, the noticing and the attention heightens and enriches the experience. This can take a mighty effort, but the energy spent is priceless. 

Effort doesn’t have to be 100% all of the time or even 80% or 60%. Even if the effort is lackluster, any awkward intermingling with ideas intensifies apparency. §[[202106140552]]‹ Grab even the pico-sized moments and let the compounding feedback cycle explode. ›[[202106140557]] Each time ideas are danced with, we get in a little more sync.

Ideation is serendipitous. Being tackled by ideas and wrestling with them is a privilege. I am the lucky one. “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.” ― **Roman philosopher Seneca**

The volume of ideas, good and bad, valuable and worthless, appreciate and inappropriate, is increasing. The measure of a good idea is the answer to the question, “Is this consistent with the person I want to be?.” And “Is this idea intricately connected to my objectives?” And “Will it lead to an opportunity to express gratitude?” And “Will this idea encourage me to wake up to the wonderment of this bright moment?”
