“Don’t let yourself be. Find something new to try, something to change. Count how often it succeeds and how often it doesn’t. Write about it. Ask a patient or a colleague what they think about it. See if you can keep the conversation going.” 
― Atul Gawande

 > Only by conversations in which experienced thinkers exchange information about their actual ways of working can a useful sense of method and theory be imparted to the beginning student.

Stressing again the importance of developing and learning conversation skills.

Richard Hamming - The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn.

> Brains are nice to have but they are even better if you know how to use them.

Minds don't come with owner's manuals. We have to develop our own using a haphazard array of gadgets and hacks. This takes a real long time unless we stand on the shoulders of the giants who came before us.

> If what you are working on is not important and aligned with your goals—and a lot of what you do and say isn’t—then why are you doing it? The question you need to ask yourself if “why are you not working on and thinking about the important problems in your area?” How can we expect to achieve great things if we are not working on the right problems?

- The four quadrants of time usage [[202108081059]]

Ask "Why are you not working on and thinking about the important problems you can affect?"

> This isn’t about who works the hardest but rather who focuses their limited energy on the right things. Learning things that (1) change slowly and (2) apply to a wide variety of situations could be a better use of time than learning something incredibly time-consuming, rapidly changing, and of limited application. Hamming dedicated his Friday afternoons to “great thoughts.” Setting aside time to think is a common of people that do great things. Not only does this help you live consciously it helps get your head out of the weeds. The rest of us are too busy with the details to ask if we’re going in the right direction.

# Slowly Spreading Ideas
Subatomic: Some ideas aren't made to spread quickly.

Anesthesia as an idea only became a thing in the mid-1800s. It was quickly adopted and became its own medical specialty. In the 1860s, the Edinburgh surgeon Joseph Lister saw the link between hand washing and sterilization and infection, but it took years for surgeons to adopt the practices that saved lives. Why did these two ideas take such a different trajectory?

- A-Ignaz Semmelweis Pioneered Hand Washing [[202011181945]]

The primary reason for quicker adoption was because what is easy has less resistance to getting adopted.
- Anesthetic put the patient out, and the surgeon can take his time with the procedure. Previously he had to hurry because of a screaming, writhing patient. From the surgeon's POV, this is easy, from the patient's POV, there is nothing to remember. 

- Hand cleaning required diligent work and remembering to do the steps. The result was not so immediate. 
> The technical complexity might have been part of the difficulty. Giving Lister’s methods “a try” required painstaking attention to detail. Surgeons had to be scrupulous about soaking their hands, instruments, and even their catgut sutures in antiseptic solution.

With anesthesia, it became easy for the surgeons when the specialty was moved to someone else.
> Faced with the complexities, they didn’t give up; instead, they formed an entirely new medical specialty—anesthesiology.

- Paradigm flipping [[202311140626]]
     * A paradigm is our mental model of the world. Be bold and imagine a different future.
- Setting priorities for idea review [[202208031502]]

> So, what were the key differences? First, one combatted a visible and immediate problem (pain); the other combatted an invisible problem (germs) whose effects wouldn’t be manifest until well after the operation. Second, although both made life better for patients, only one made life better for doctors. Anesthesia changed surgery from a brutal, time-pressured assault on a shrieking patient to a quiet, considered procedure.

- Other ideas that stall. A solution may be available, but adoption lags. Typically invisible problems get neglected. 
  1. Global Warming
  2. Health crisis from industrial foods
  3. Student loan debt [[202201202035]]
  4. Plastic pollution
  5. Environmental degradation
