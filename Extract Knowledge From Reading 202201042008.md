# Extract Knowledge form Reading
Subatomic: The five step knowledge creation process.

Looking at reading in as detailed as this will slow the reading down tremendously. I don't have to be perfect at this. This can be my goal and who knows.

Some zettel can have two parts. The 'premise' of the idea expressed and it use case.

Some zettel can have up to seven parts. Described below.

–––––
**Premise:** If these five are the signifiers of knowledge we can use it as a tool to create or at least understand knowledge.

**Use:** Use these five dimensions of knowledge to analyse any piece of unfolded opaque paragraph and to enrich information so it becomes actual knowledge

1. Truth. 
	- Arguments 
	- Evidence 
2. Relevancy. 
3. Usefulness. 
4. Beauty
5. Simpleness

Sascha's zettel.
